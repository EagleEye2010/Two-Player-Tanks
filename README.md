# Two Player Tanks

This is a Windows game that is made in Unity. Just download, unzip, and play!

There might be a screen that says "Windows Defender protected your PC". Just click "View more" and then "Run anyway". It is caused because I need to pay $$$ to Microsoft to get a special license.

## How to Play:
- Controls for Player 1: WASD to move, F to shoot.
- Controls for Player 2: Arrow Keys to move, Space to shoot.
- Destroy your opponent to win (obviously).

## Credits
- Wood textures from Unity Asset Store.
- A tad bit of inspiration from Wii Play Tanks.
- Everything else by me.

## Notes
I know that you can glitch out of the map - as far as I'm concerned, this is a small game and it doesn't matter that much. However, if you guys want a bug fix I certainly can do that :) . Also, there is no end scene - this is just a basic tanks game.
